Domino Pizza Sales Report  </h1>**

**Project Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to analyze the sales trends of Domino's revenue by examining three key areas: category sales, ingredient sales, and sales by day. Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns and insights that can inform better decision-making regarding staff allocation, inventory management, and sales strategies. Specifically, the project will:

1. **Identify the most popular pizza categories and ingredients**, helping to streamline ingredient procurement and preparation processes.
2. **Provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing staff allocation** based on sales patterns and demand fluctuations throughout the week.
3. **Suggest targeted sales strategies** to increase the sales of underperforming pizzas, leveraging insights into customer preferences and purchasing behaviors.

By applying these findings, the project will help Domino's enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource usage, and ultimately drive sales growth across its menu.

Sales Performance Overview:
In 2015, around **21,000 orders** were placed, gererating a total revenue of** $817.86 thousand dollar** with the **average revenue** per order at **$38.81** over **50,000 pizza sold**. Sale throughout the year is consistent with a slight decrease in Quarter 4.

For daily trend, Friday and Saturday are the most busiest day, and during a day there are 2 rush times, lunch rush (12PM to 1PM) and dinner rush (6PM to 8PM). 

For size, three sizes Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L) dominate revenue. To be more specific, L pizzas contribute the highest revenue while S and M pizzas also have significant contributions. On the other hand, Extra Extra Large (XXL) pizzas are rarely ordered.

For category, Supreme leads the revenue with 26.91% of total revenue, followed by Veggie (25.46%), chicken (23.96%), and Classic (23.68) categories. Chicken takes the second lowest revenue percentage while top 2 best sellers are dominated by Thai Chicken Pizza and Barbecue Chicken Pizza, which belongs to Chicken category. This demonstrate strong customer preference for chicken ingredient.

Category Analysis:
In general, L size takes the most revenue for all category while the revenue falls in higher price tier. Veggie pizzas have lower overall revenue compared to Supreme and Classic due to potentially lower demand. Sales share the same trend across all category, sales decline from September to December. However, with the dip in Pizza quantity, the revenue still maintain nearly the same compared to other months. This could be explained by the fact that of big size (L, XL and XXL) are sold in these time.

For **Chicken** category, the revenue is dominated by L size while there is no order for XL and XXL size. For total revenue, L size dominates the revenue followed by M and S sizes.
For **Supreme** and **Veggie** category,  the revenue focuses on 3 sizes only (S, M and L), which is the same with Chicken category. L size also dominates the revenue followed by M and S sizes. Whereas for **Classic**, sales are shared across all the size (S, M, L, XL and XXL). However, while L size still dominates revenue but it is followed by S and M size instead of M and S trend. 

Recommendation: The organisation should focus on three size only (S, M and L) while pay more attention to L size as it dominates total revenue. 
S and M size are smaller, which is suitable for an individual or a couple. Therefore, in order to upsell these size, organisation should create a promotion for M size, such as buy 1 pizza get 50% off for 1 drink. 
For low performance category, organisation should consider run a 1-day promotion, such as "Veggie Tuesday" ‚Äì 20% off for All Veggie pizzas. or "Chicken Sunday" ‚Äì buy 1 get 50% off for the next chicken pizza.
