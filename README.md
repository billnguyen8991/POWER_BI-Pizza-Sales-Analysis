Domino Pizza Sales Report  </h1>**

**Project Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to analyze the sales trends of Domino's revenue by examining three key areas: category sales, ingredient sales, and sales by day. Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns and insights that can inform better decision-making regarding staff allocation, inventory management, and sales strategies. Specifically, the project will:

1. **Identify the most popular pizza categories and ingredients**, helping to streamline ingredient procurement and preparation processes.
2. **Provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing staff allocation** based on sales patterns and demand fluctuations throughout the week.
3. **Suggest targeted sales strategies** to increase the sales of underperforming pizzas, leveraging insights into customer preferences and purchasing behaviors.

By applying these findings, the project will help Domino's enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource usage, and ultimately drive sales growth across its menu.
