"Suppose you are a Data Analyst for a company that manufactures and distributes pizza. Analyze the dataset to find insights and provide suggestions to improve the business situation. The dataset consists of 2 files:
- 'Data_pizza.xlsx': The dataset describes the transactions of the store.
- 'Data_dictionary.xlsx': Describes the data in the 'Data_pizza' table.

Here is a set of analytical requests that could help in developing the business operations of your company:
1. Sales Trend Analysis: Analyze the sales trends over time to identify patterns, seasonal variations, or any anomalies. This could involve daily, weekly, and monthly sales performance, comparing year-over-year changes to understand growth or decline in sales.

2. Product Performance: Assess the performance of different pizza categories and specific pizzas within those categories in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated. Identify top-selling and underperforming pizzas to adjust the product offering accordingly.

3. Price Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluate how changes in the price of pizzas affect sales volume to understand the price elasticity of demand for different pizza types. This can help in optimizing pricing strategies to maximize revenue.

4. Customer Purchase Patterns: Analyze order data to identify common customer purchase patterns, such as the most popular pizza sizes, favorite ingredients, and combinations. This insight can be used to tailor marketing strategies and develop targeted promotions.

5. Ingredient Analysis: Examine the popularity of ingredients across different pizzas to identify which ingredients are most and least popular. This analysis can inform inventory management and possibly the development of new pizza recipes that cater to customer preferences.
